Dataset overview:

The dataset used is taken from UCI repository. 
The dataset has 563 features which are constructed from triaxial sensors present in the mobile. The activity/ target variable is any one of the six classes.
The signal preprocessed csv files are taken as input for this project.

In this project we aim to predict the human activity using traditional ML models and different dimensionality reduction techniques.
